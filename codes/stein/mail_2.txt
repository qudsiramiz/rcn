Ramiz,


There should now be a python script that connects to the database
and plots something (histogram of events). See:

Other python examples (different database, but same principle) can
be found e.g., here:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0uweewu3g65qvrw/AAAeQeKHL-I1SgRQzSD77YU2a


.. and the SQL scripts loaded by the python code can be
found here:

Note that you can create 'template SQLs' and fillariables
etc, from your Python / Matlab code before executing the queries.

Some jetting information is already in the database - probably
in the table MMS2up_ions. Check contents and description of
the table content with the following SQL:

        SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM MMS2up_ions;

..and check whether e.g., the parameters

t_Vmaxbrst = time where max |V| occurs,
Vmax_tht  = maximum |V| [km/s] within HT interval



.. are of any use.

Good luck. Get in touch if you get stuck., but note
that we are out of town from 17-25 April
